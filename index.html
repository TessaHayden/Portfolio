            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>My father was a restaurant owner and consultant, so I grew up working in the hospitality industry.  I have expereince bartending, serving, hostessing and bussing.  I've worked in restaurants and catered events.  After working in restaurants I was a set designer and builder for photography studios in Los Angeles, CA.  For 7 years I ran a small business with my partner, buying and selling used pro audio gear, electronics and household goods.  We also rented a warehouse in the heart of Skid Row which we used for private parties, events, film and photography shoots.  During covid our business was shutdown and I decided to choose a path towards the future.  Since technology is a growing industry I chose to take the programming route and ended up at Epicodus.</p>
